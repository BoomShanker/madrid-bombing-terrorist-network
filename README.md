# madrid-bombing-terrorist-network
This repository analyzes and investigates the terrorist network behind the Madrid train bombing in 2004. I analyse basic centrality and similarity measures and create beautiful and interactive network visualizations. 

The centrality measures degree and strength are used to spot the most highly connected terrorists in the network. Betweenness shows the most influential ties among terrorists in the network.
